# Servlets - Form Data

You must have come across many situations when you need to pass some information from your browser to web server and ultimately to your backend program. The browser uses two methods to pass this information to web server. These methods are GET Method and POST Method.

## GET Method

The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the **?**(question mark) symbol as follows −

```
http://www.test.com/hello?key1 = value1&key2 = value2
```

The GET method is the default method to pass information from browser to web server and it produces a long string that appears in your browser's Location:box. Never use the GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to pass to the server. The GET method has size limitation: only 1024 characters can be used in a request string.

This information is passed using QUERY_STRING header and will be accessible through QUERY_STRING environment variable and Servlet handles this type of requests using **doGet()** method.

## POST Method

A generally more reliable method of passing information to a backend program is the POST method. This packages the information in exactly the same way as GET method, but instead of sending it as a text string after a ? (question mark) in the URL it sends it as a separate message. This message comes to the backend program in the form of the standard input which you can parse and use for your processing. Servlet handles this type of requests using **doPost()** method.

## Reading Form Data using Servlet

Servlets handles form data parsing automatically using the following methods depending on the situation −

- **getParameter()** − You call request.getParameter() method to get the value of a form parameter.
- **getParameterValues()** − Call this method if the parameter appears more than once and returns multiple values, for example checkbox.
- **getParameterNames()** − Call this method if you want a complete list of all parameters in the current request.

```java
package com.hdr.firstWeb;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

@WebServlet(name = "HelloGet")
public class HelloGet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter writer = response.getWriter();
        String title = "Using GET Method to Read Form Data";
        String docType =
                "<!doctype html public \"-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 " + "transitional//en\">\n";

        writer.println(docType +
                "<html>\n" +
                "<head><title>" + title + "</title></head>\n" +
                "<body bgcolor = \"#f0f0f0\">\n" +
                "<h1 align = \"center\">" + title + "</h1>\n" +
                "<ul>\n" +
                "  <li><b>First Name</b>: " +
                request.getParameter("first_name") + "\n" +
                "  <li><b>Last Name</b>: " +
                request.getParameter("last_name") + "\n" +
                "</ul>\n" +
                "</body></html> "
        );
    }
}
```



## Reading All Form Parameters

Following is the generic example which uses **getParameterNames()** method of HttpServletRequest to read all the available form parameters. This method returns an Enumeration that contains the parameter names in an unspecified order

Once we have an Enumeration, we can loop down the Enumeration in standard way by, using *hasMoreElements()* method to determine when to stop and using *nextElement()* method to get each parameter name.
